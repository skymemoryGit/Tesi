THE END <br />
In memory of my two years studying cybersecurity at the University of Padua after I graduated from my bachelor's degree in software engineering in Covid-19 period.

再见 青春<br />
永远的故乡<br />
再见 青春<br />
永恒的迷惘<br />
Goodbye Youth<br />
Forever Hometown<br />
Goodbye Youth<br />
Eternal Disorientation<br />
